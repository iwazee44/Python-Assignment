      "Question 1: Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
      "\n",
      "ANS: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a type of programming in which one can not only define the data type of a data structure, but also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question 2: List down the Benefits of OOP?\n",
      "\n",
      "ANS: OOP has become a fundamental part of software development. Below mentioned are 4 of the top benefits of OOP:\n",
      "1. Modularity for easier troubleshooting\n",
      "2. Reuse of code through inheritance\n",
      "3. Flexibility through polymorphism\n",
      "4. Effective problem solving\n",
      "\n",
      "Question 3: Differentiate between function and method?\n",
      "\n",
      "ANS: A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences:\n",
      "1. A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.\n",
      "2. A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data).\n",
      "\n",
      "Question 4: Define the following terms:\n",
      "1. Class\n",
      "A class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them. In python a class is created by the keyword 'class'.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Object\n",
      "An object is created using the constructor of the class. This object will then be called the instance of the class. In Python we create instances in the following manner\n",
      "Instance = class(arguments)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Attribute\n",
      "A class by itself is of no use unless there is some functionality associated with it. Functionalities are defined by setting attributes, which act as containers for data and functions related to those attributes.\n",
      "You can define the following class with the name 'Snake'. This class will have an attribute 'name'.\n",
      "\n",
      ">>> class Snake:\n",
      "...     name = \"python\" # set an attribute `name` of the class\n",
      "...\n",
      "You can assign the class to a variable. This is called object instantiation. You will then be able to access the attributes that are present inside the class using the dot . operator. For example, in the Snake example, you can access the attribute name of the class 'Snake'.\n",
